# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

      ourHistory: Our history
      descriptionCommon_4: The enterprise UPPA WINERY was founded in 2008 by Pavel Shvets, the man who is really fond of wine and loves his native land. The winemaker was born and grew up in Sevastopol city, then studied in St. Petersburg city and Moscow city. In 1996 Pavel started his working carrier as a wine steward, so, he was among the first who mastered this profession in Russia. In 2000 he was declared “The best wine steward” of the country. On his return from the capital the winemaker laid out his first vineyard in his native Sevastopol city. The basic philosophy of Pavel Shvets is terroir characteristics and uniqueness in every bottle.

      descriptionCommon_5: UPPA WINERY is the only Russian winery that produces biodynamic wine. “UPPA” translated from Tatar means “Mother”. At the same time this is the name of a small river flowing nearby Rodnoye village where the wine estate is situated. Because of the unique character of Sevastopol terroir and climatic distinctions of Uppinskaya kotlovina (Russian term for Uppa hollow) our wines have truly special qualities which clearly distinguish them among the others.

      enter: Join the Uppa Club!
      descriptionCommon_1: Join our Wine Club and enjoy its benefits. UPPA WINERY wine is widely known among connoisseurs and the major part of it is reserved by distributing companies prior to bottling. We’re sorry to tell you that due to a limited edition we are not always ready to provide required quantity to individual customers and collectors. For the purpose of direct selling we have created the UPPA WINERY Club. So, its members have an opportunity to buy the wine first, directly and at special prices. Also, members of the community receive notifications about availability of every batch of our wine.
      what_to_know: About the Club

      know_li_2: Both membership and each batch of wine are limited.  
      know_li_3: Outgoing minimum quantity of wine makes 12 bottles of the same item.  
      know_li_4: Dispatch is performed after 100% advance payment.
      know_li_5: Delivery is at your expense. It is important to bear in mind that in summer wine could be spoiled due to overheat, and in winter — due to overcooling.

      descriptionCommon_1: “The main idea of our winery is to make the wine unique. I grow grape in harmony with the environment and do my best to make our vines to become a part of the ecosystem in which they were brought”, - these are the Pavel Svets words. The UPPA WINERY vineyards are divided into two parts. Each of these parts is characterized by special natural features that allow creating very much different wines.
      cler_polati: Cler Polati
      descriptionCommon_2: This vineyard owes its name to the location on the southern slope. Rows are orientated from the north to the south at a height of 380-410 meters above sea level. Such exposition allows catching maximum of warmth and light. Long ago people from nearest villages noticed how this site is heated by Crimean sun and called it “Polati” in a similar way to an upper deck of a Russian stove.

      cler_nummulite: Cler Numullite
      descriptionCommon_3: The name of this vineyard refers directly to the UPPA WINERY terroir. Nummulite (from the Latin word “numus” that means “coin”) is a genus of extinct sea organisms. A plenty of shells of such organisms are found at the vineyard. This points to the fact that our parent material used to be an ocean floor in relatively recent geological time (about 145-450 million years ago).
